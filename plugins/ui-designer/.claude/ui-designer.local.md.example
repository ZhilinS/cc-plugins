# UI Designer Settings

This file customizes the UI Designer plugin for your preferences.

## How to Use

1. Copy this file to `.claude/ui-designer.local.md` in your project
2. Customize the YAML frontmatter with your preferences
3. Add screenshot references to your project
4. The plugin will automatically use these settings

## Screenshot References

Place your reference screenshots in your project (e.g., `design-refs/` directory) and reference them with relative paths above. The plugin will:
- Analyze these screenshots when creating UI
- Compare generated UI against these references
- Extract design patterns and aesthetics from them

## Notes Section

Use this section below the frontmatter to add any additional context about your design preferences, brand guidelines, or specific aesthetic directions.
